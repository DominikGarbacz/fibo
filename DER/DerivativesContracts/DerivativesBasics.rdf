        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20200401/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to loosen the domain of the hasUnderlier property, which could be either an instrument or leg, refine the definition of Underlier and hasUnderlier based on recent work on swaps, add the definition of a contract for difference (CFD), simplify the contract party hierarchy where the subclasses of contract party do not add semantics, add the concepts of underlying asset valuation and calculation agent, which are needed for various derivatives (moved from forwards) and eliminate the language related to transactions as well as the distinction between an OTC contract and exchange-traded contract / listed security, given how blurry the lines are today, across derivatives.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20201201/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate hasThirdParty as a superproperty of hasCalculationAgent, which led to unintended reasoning consequences, added concepts and properties specific to settlement and valuation required for futures, forwards, and options, and moved general properties from forwards and swaps up to derivatives basics.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20210301/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to replace hasContractSize with hasLotSize.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20210501/DerivativesContracts/DerivativesBasics.rdf version of this ontology was modified to move designated contract market to the markets ontology in FBC and eliminate the notion of NonPhysicalUnderlier, which was determined to add unnecessary overhead.</skos:changeNote>

        <skos:definition>terms setting out a cashflow structure of payments committed to by one party to a contract</skos:definition>
        <skos:editorialNote>Swap cashflows are known as Swapstreams and are the terms for payment to and from either party. These are defined in swap transaction messages and represent the terms of the contract implied by that transaction. Options (Nordea reviews): Cashflows are defined as Payouts. This is not the same as a model of a cashflow which is a consequence of applying some legal term for payment of interest or principal, but is a commitment expressed in purely cashflow terms. Review this though. Payout terms include: Values - values can only go up or down; Static values are defined for limits and the like. i.e. Constraints (and direction) - this covers caps and floors - these are read upward or downward Conditionality Formula relations (Input and Output): - these are values - these may have a cap or a floor on them also - these also may have Multiplication - there is also fixed margin - may have addition or substraction between these Linearity in covered in the above Timing / expiry Observaton (not terms): Probability Sensitivity</skos:editorialNote>

        <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">contract for difference</rdfs:label>
        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">cash-settled derivative where the parties agree to exchange on the maturity of the contract the difference between the current value of the underlying asset and the initial value of that asset when the contract is initiated</skos:definition>
        <skos:example xml:lang="en">For example, suppose the initial price of share XYZ is $100 and a CFD for 1000 shares is exchanged. Both the buyer and seller must post some margin. If the price goes to $105, then the buyer gets $5,000 from the seller. If the price goes to $95, the buyer pays the seller $5,000. This contract avoids ownership of the stock and all the associated transactions issues (like stamp taxes). The contract also allows for leverage (typically 10:1) because the margin that must be posted is only a fraction of the value of the underlying asset.</skos:example>
