        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20190201/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20200201/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to eliminate the property &apos;hasPaymentSchedule&apos; from this ontology in favor of the equivalent property with the same name from FND, adding concepts related to statistical swaps, and revising definitions to be ISO 704 compliant.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20200901/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to integrate return swaps and connect swap legs to the swap they comprise, as appropriate, simplify the contract party hierarchy, add basic fixed and floating legs as higher level concepts common to many swaps, and eliminate ambiguity in definitions.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20201201/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to move the property &apos;exchanges&apos; to FND given that it could be applied more generally than with respect to swaps only, facilitate the elimination of the property &apos;mayBeTradedIn&apos;, which was only used in one place and was redundant with the concept of a ListedSecurity / Listing in SEC, and move two properties, hasPayingParty and hasReceivingParty to DerivativesBasics to facilitate wider use.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20210301/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to move swap execution facility to the markets ontology in FBC.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20210701/DerivativesContracts/Swaps/ version of this ontology was modified to add the concept of a rates swap and the corresponding rate-based leg to facilitate mapping to the CFI standard.</skos:changeNote>

The difference in this case is not driven by different interest rate periods but from different markets, i.e., the difference in efficiency between the two markets. The objective is to hedge against basis risk which is the difference in price between two markets. See also forward swap, as a means for controlling interest rate.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
